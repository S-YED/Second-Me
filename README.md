## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, **YOU**.

We’re challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**—a new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It’s **locally trained and hosted**—your data, your control—yet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it’s your AI identity interface—a bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow’s truly native AI apps.

Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts, Join us! Second Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

## Quick Start

### 📊 Model Size vs. Memory (Reference Guide)

*Note: "B" in the table represents "billion parameters model". Data shown are examples only; actual supported model sizes may vary depending on system optimization, deployment environment, and other hardware/software conditions.*

| Memory (GB) | Docker Deployment (Windows/Linux) | Docker Deployment (Mac) | Integrated Setup (Windows/Linux) | Integrated Setup (Mac) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 8            | ~0.8B (example)                | ~0.4B (example)       | ~1.0B (example)              | ~0.6B (example)    |
| 16           | 1.5B (example)                 | 0.5B (example)        | ~2.0B (example)              | ~0.8B (example)    |
| 32           | ~2.8B (example)                | ~1.2B (example)       | ~3.5B (example)              | ~1.5B (example)    |

> **Note**: Models below 0.5B may not provide satisfactory performance for complex tasks. And we're continuously improving cross-platform support - please [submit an issue](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/issues/new) for feedback or compatibility problems on different operating systems.

> **MLX Acceleration**: Mac M-series users can use [MLX](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/tree/master/lpm_kernel/L2/mlx_training) to run larger models (CLI-only).

### ⚡ Get your Second Me running in just 3 steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
# 2. Start Docker containers
make docker-up
# 3. Access the web interface
# Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### Install and Run Second Me (WSL / Ubuntu Integrated Setup)

## 0. Short Checklist Before You Start

✅ Ensure WSL2 Ubuntu is updated

🛠️ Node.js 23+ installed inside WSL using nvm

## 1. Move Project to WSL Filesystem

📂 Copy project from /mnt/c to ~/Second-Me directory

📁 Use cp -r "/mnt/c/Users/..." ~/Second-Me command

## 2. Install System Dependencies

⚙️ Run sudo apt update and install build-essential, cmake, g++, libssl-dev, python3-dev, etc.

🔧 Required tools: net-tools, libinotifytools0-dev, pkg-config

## 3. Install Node.js 23 Using nvm

🌐 Download and install nvm via script

🔢 Install and activate Node.js version 23 using nvm commands

## 4. Python Environment Setup

🐍 Activate Python virtual environment (.venv) or Poetry

📦 Install or upgrade huggingfacehub package

## 5. Download and Merge Qwen Model

⬇️ Download split Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF model files using huggingface-cli

🔗 Merge split files using llama-gguf-split --merge tool

## 6. Start llama-server

🚀 Launch llama-server with model, memory config, host and port parameters

🔌 Example: ./llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server -m models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4km.gguf -c 4096 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080

## 7. Fix PostHog Telemetry Spam

🛑 Disable telemetry by adding TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 to .env file

## 8. Start Second Me Services

🔄 Restart services using make restart command

## 9. Frontend Startup Troubleshooting

🖥️ Navigate to lpmfrontend directory if frontend doesn’t start automatically

🔄 Use nvm to select Node.js 23, clear node_modules and .next folders, reinstall dependencies, and run frontend

## 10. Kill Stale Processes or Ports

❌ Free ports 3000 and 8002 using sudo fuser -k commands
